### Step 1 - Open specified file from command line and print contents to stdout -> :white_check_mark:
### Step 2 - Read input from stdin and ouput to stdout   
### Step 3 - Concatenate files 
### Step 4 - Number the lines as they're printed out 
### Step 5 - Number lines, both including and excluding non-blank lines
